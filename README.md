# VBA-challenge

**Instructions**


1.  Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

    *   The ticker symbol.

    *   Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

    *   The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

    *   The total stock volume of the stock.


2.  You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


**BONUS**

Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.


**Author's Notes**

I also added an additional page on which I combined the data from the previous pages. 

I have 2 modules. The first one creates the summary tables described in the instructions as well as combining the data onto one worksheet.
At the end of the first module a button is made on the Combined Data sheet which allows the user to run the second module.

The second module creates the summary table described in the Bonus section.
